# SpaceIn
Spacein is a dynamic, space-themed website that fetches daily images and data directly from NASA's public API. It showcases stunning space photography and relevant information, giving users a fresh cosmic experience every day. This project helped me practice working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and building interactive, data-driven web pages
